description: >
  Dates in Synthetics are based on UTC by default, but sometimes you have a requirement for a timezone based date. Daylight Savings makes this more challenging. 
  This snippet creates a Date object using a variable offset based on whether or not US based Daylight Savings is active.
  This script was created for Eastern Standard Time / Eastern Daylight Time. Adjust the offsets in getOffset for other time zones.
